tomyam golok memang terbaikk,1
Agak2 la lepas ni nak menipu pun. Bukan aku tak selalu makan kedai ni. Amaun RM53.80 kau pergi mark up sampai RM74.80. Resit tak bagi.  memang last la aku datang sini.Kalau aku tak double check  mintak resit memang kau telan macam tu jela duit aku. Korang yang nak datang sini make sure mintak resit k. Ada sorang bro kat cashier tu menipu. Hati2,0
"Service slow as f. Belum lagi customer service dorang. Takda senyum, takda maaf, bila kita panggil order, takda orang nak datang. Lalu lalang je sebelah kami tapi ambik order pun tak. Senang cerita, kalau nak cepat jangan makan sini, kalau jenis tak boleh nak hadap perangai pekerja macam ni, elok lah jangan makan sini. Boleh tambah dosa kering mencarut dalam hati. Boleh buat darah tinggi jugak.",0
"nasi goreng golok masin. lebih 40 minit tggu makanan sampai. for me, staff rude, cust tggu makan lama tp tak ada cakap sorry. n bila complain cakap tunggu makanan lama, staff cakap standard setngh jam tnggu makanan. for me, kita beli makan semua pakai duit. nasi goreng rm10. i bukan nak marah, but maybe u guys should change your service. i mean not to fast , tapi biar lambat, asalkan puas hati & staff friendly. sorry fr this comment but my family really disappointed. it's oka… See more",0

"kawan saya order lamb kabsah, saya order lamb madghut, and we ordered adani tea in pot dan olive salad. Daging lamb sedap tapi nasik agak mengecewakan. Yang paling tak menyeronokan adalah attitude waiter. Lain kali kalau bahan tak ada jangan paksa customer makan benda yang tak diorder. Datang meja customer dulu bagitahu olive tak ada, then tak payah nak translate olive tu apa. Perli² pulak. Saya ada hak untuk cancel salad Arab yang penuh kobis serta sedikit tomato tu..tak payah bawak piring salad Arab ke belakang and perli perli bergelak ketawa zaiton mana zaiton. Mana datang perangai pelayan kedai begini ya. Maaf I cannot recommend your restaurant to my family or friends until your staff diajar manner kerja di kedai makan yang betul",1

"Customer service need to improve. When we order seafood waitress /waiter always said can order but need to wait for long hours.
Then we order western as per suggested still need to wait about 2hrs to get only for chicken chop & spaghetti meatball, plus 2 cup of juices need to wait about 1hrs after we follow up at their kitchen.
We come far from KL just to try their famous cuisine unfortunately this is what we get.
In this case I will not recommended your esteemed restaurant to my fellow friends & families.
Sorry for my bad review but this is my  experience and hopefully no one feels same bad experience as my situation.
Please improve your service for better quality and customer always right.",0

Complained to the staff about burnt fried dumpling. The reaction was “Oh yang buat tu dah tahu terlebih goreng. Maaf ya” �. Bad customer service. Wont come again.,0
"The workers at the front line was bickering over an order that was wrongly made, and the male worker keeps on saying 'bodo bodo' to the female worker. It was like a sexual harassment just because the female can't exactly do anything but argue with him so she finally walked away. So unethical. That really ruined my family dinner & celebration. Hello, solve the matter professionally! They were so loud but there were only a few customers so they don't pay attention to any of it. The manager should check the CCTV or something. 12/3/3019 some time at 11.30pm. Other workers just watched them as if nothing is going on.",0

"i went to Tong Juan after so many years craving for the shell crab. but i am dissapointed that dish is not the same as it was before. the coating of the crab last time is a thin layer of fried omlette but now looks like the shell crab was wrapped with thick layer like egg+bread? we order fried rice as well but could not finish the rice, so we asked them to pack the balance of unfinished food. it was lunch time around 12. we reached KL around 6pm, and feeling hungry again i reached for the pack fried rice, but already stale, basi! how come? so sad...",0
reasonable price for stuffed crab n steamed fish,1
Very disappointing that they do not allow takeaway of stuff crabs. What nonsense is this when on their timeline it shows packed lunch with stuffed crabs?!,0
Good food with reasonable price,1
Best baked crab in Mesia. Lobster good too. we're back after 20 years. food is still just as good. ,1
Lots of seafood! No pork!,1
"Yummy, fair price, comfortable environmental hygiene, goooooooooood",1
One of the best restaurants to come to have a decent meal in Cukai town. The Stuffed Crabs and the BBQ Prawns is something not to be missed.,1
"Old place, more than 30 years ago I worked in ""Jugai"" for 2 years and 7 months. This shop is very famous, has been to eat delicious food, too long people have forgotten, everything is delicious.",1
Very nice 👍 & delicious 😋 dinner,1
"This place is overrated for sure. Stuffed crab is OK at best, prawns were over cooked, fried rice was bland and the chicken bits in it has odour - frozen smell. So don't bother, you can find better food else where.",1
Good for family and food is good,1
stuffed crab must go with chili sauce,1
The food here is simply delicious!,1

Tasty... must give it a try...,1
"Come all the way from JB to eat crabs, hope for crabs here. Crabs are not sweet and not special. Sotong sambal cooked too hard, it feels like it's not fresh and it's rarely taste the same. We ordered two BBQ tiger shrimp here, especially expensive RM39, really not delicious! . . The crab fried rice here is not bad. It smells good. The two of us had a total of RM124.55 here (plus a plate of mixed vegetables and a cup of Tang tea). I think it's too expensive and not worth it",0
"I and my hubby having dinner on 6 Nov, We order stuffed crab, kangkong balacan, Lala and fried chicken. Two of us had stomachache at the night. We went to hospital and is food positioning. It spoil our holiday trip.",0
Is a very nice place. Next time you have a chance to come back to this Dongyuan to taste its crabs and coffee ice,1

"Disappointed with stuffed crab as it was fried and lack the umph. Fair price at RM10 each. But the sotong curry was over cooked (RM28) Fish ball(20pcs) soup was so so(RM28). Kailan so so. To me, it us rather high price as quantity and taste were below par. 4.8/10",0
Quite expensive.,0
The best seafood in Kemanman.,1
"Crab is ok, steamed fish grouper looks like chicken",0
Pretty good meal price is not an issue if it's for a good one,1
Yes the price is slightly more than some other in Kemaman but the quality is good. Stuffed Crab and any of the prawn prawn get my vote as well as Geena's smile!,1
"The stuffed crab is really tempting  cant resist it , two is not enough for me  i want more",1
Stuff is getting too touristy. . Price wise,1
Year after year it tastes worse. Not a bit of taste is too outrageous. The price is killing me.,0
"Went to this restaurant during Awal Muharam Holiday 2013, and I think this restaurant over charge! Sotong being charge for RM66!! It's not a big portion, there were only 4 of us. 2 senior citizens and 2 female. We ended up paying RM200++ for 4 stuff crab (RM34), 4x tiger prawn (RM48), Crab meat fried rice (RM24), Steam red Garaupa (RM55), Fried Sotong (RM66), fried bean (RM20) and extra RM8 for not sure what is that, maybe wet tissue we used.
I was shocked when i received the bill.. its way too expansive!!
I asked why the sotong being charge so expansive, the guy said because it’s a big size sotong.
I don’t think a big size sotong worth that much.
Be careful when you walk in, ask the price before you order. There is no price listed on the menu.",0

Mangkuk dan pinggan sumbing, 1kg Lamb + rice (utk 5 org) but don't think that was 1kg. Sorg dapat seketul daging kambing yg bukannya penuh Daging. Sampaikan perlu ambil another couple set Hanya utk Daging kambing tu. Shawarma pun tak sesedap dan penuh seperti yg di war2kan. Overall makanan Tidak sama langsung dgn yg ditunjukkan di dalam menu. Datang kerana review yg gah tapi kecewa dengan segalanya. 1st and last.
BTW, the lady owner/supervisor told us that they will contact us (don't know why but maybe for apologize) but until now there's no text or call from them. Kami lunch di sana pd 10 Sept 2023.
Update: The PIC wsp me after look at the review that I wrote and hehad apologize sincerely. He told me on that day, almost all the senior staff hv a app with immigration dept. Only the new staff working on that time.  Accepted his apologise n the case closed.",0

Had lamb shoulder for dinner. Meat was thick compared to other places. Kitchen close at 9pm today and it's Saturday...so go early.,1
"I had a dinner with my wife at this restaurant. Going by the website, we were expecting a great evening.
1. Appetiser
- Cream of Tomato and Cream of Mushroom soups were very tasty. I recommend.
- Garlic bread was good; right amount of garlic.
2. Mains
We ordered:
(i) Chicken Navarin
- very disappointing.
- over-cooked chicken; very chewy.
- bland sauce; felt more like 'maggie' soup than a vegetable stew.
(ii) Lamb Shoulder
- not consistently cooked; ranged between fully cooked and rare.
- mint sauce was quite good.
3. Desert
- Tiramisu and Creme Brulee was OK - have tasted better.
4. Overall service
- Waiter brought us our mains while we are still drinking our soup. And waited for me to clear the table for him to put down the mains. Not professional enough to realise that:
(i) we were not done with the soups.
(ii) one main is here and the other is not here.
- He was not happy that we told him that we need more time. Felt as if he was rushing through service so he can go back to 'play on his phone' (which we saw).
- Strongly not recommend to have such waiters who show attitude to customers.",0

"Had dinner here with a few of my colleagues and all of us enjoyed dinner very much! Every dish was cooked perfectly and well presented. We ordered the teriyaki salmon & mushroom alfredo pasta, chicken confit aglio olio, belacan seafood aglio olio, beef steak (the potato gratin was really good!), salted egg & tempura prawn alfredo and beef pizza. Oh! We also had the chilli clams (comes with 2 slices of toasted baguette) as appetizer!! Will definitely revisit with my family and more friends.",1

"I didn't get a chance to try their mains, but
WORSE ICE CREAM SUNDAE & TIRAMISU EVER.
Ice Cream Sundae - half melted ice cream coated in bitter coffee powder. 
Tiramisu - layers of heavy cream and coffee powder. Tasteless.
I hope their mains are better.",0
"When there for a Birthday celebration only to wait for 45 minutes for my entree to come. Well, the wait wasn't worth it.",0
"Dear Bon Appetit, today I visited you guys with my fellow colleagues. I really love the ambiance and the interior deco, very welcoming 🙂 However, our food came quite late, and some of our orders were forgotten/left out. Thanks to one really polite waiter (Rana), who was kind enough to serve us free fruits and cakes as compensation for our waiting time, we left with somewhat satisfied tummies. Food was nice, just one thing though: Why does your fish and chips as well as lamb chop has three pieces while your grilled chicken has only one piece? In my opinion, the portion for grilled chicken is too small. Way too small for a small eater like me. If you can take note of this, I would have given you 2 thumbs up ",0
Not sure whether is an honest mistake but we order their new year set for chicken cordon bleu and came with the wrong order of fish as main.. when i ask the set menu to change the main. . I was told all other main is finished and was serve with the wrongly made fish as main.. coincidence? If i was informed all finish except fish.. i rather not to choose this set course..,0
Another awesome experience at Bon Appétit today. Great lunch offerings. Must try the Hot Lemon Tea.  Special mention to Eka who took care of us.  Keep it up!,1
I love the food and service. I'm sure going again.,1
"As a pasta joint, you ought to know, and have different types of pastas to be served. The manager clearly was clueless when asked what type of pastas are available. Secondly, your spaghetti's tastes and texture is horrible. Aldente nowhere to be found, instant noodles more like it. Without any drastic measure to review your management, you're definitely wont be having repeat customers. Certainly an insult to all pasta lovers out there, but then again you get what you pay for.",0

The last time I patronised a restaurant by this name was at Yow Chuan Plaza in the late 80s. Oh how I loved that place  I think I've just rediscovered it's reincarnation,1
I am so bumped to find their tiramisu increase in price by 30% while its portion decrease by 20%!!! Sniffs.,0
"The service was friendly with a personal touch, we made a mistake and ordered bacon pasta thinking it wasn't beef, but they gladly changed it to chicken for us even after the food was served. Environment was so lovely, we're secretly wishing people won't discover the homeliness and over - crowd this sweet humble hut. It's a great and affordable place to date, mingle and dine. Will definitely return for more!",1
"One of my favorite hangout spots in PJ, nested within the quaint Oasis Square. I've been a regular since Epiphany days and still enjoyed coming over to chill and dine. Food is decent and innovative, and coffee is great! My favorites are the desserts and cakes.",1

"at times of pandemic waiter wears mask under the chin n keeps talking when serving food.
also seen to b rubbing his nose all the time without washing his hands
level of hygiene n contamination? I don't have to describe any further
the one preparing the food in the kitchen also just wears mask under the chin",0
Great food..reasonable price..good service.. my friends also enjoyed..,1
Overly priced food. The air-conditioned side of the restaurant smells like a restroom. Bad service to name a few. Used to be a really good spot to visit. Wouldn't come back here again.,0
First time trying. Random search and found this jewel in SS15/4B Subang. Really enjoyed the food. Reasonable price with generous portion. Best Arabic food I’ve tried so far. Highly recommended. ,1
Best shisha.. Best Arabic food in town highly recommended..,1
"there is so many problem.. now all food r copy from other restaurants.. be careful. before food many problem . like rice, lamb, pasta, chicken chop, now new food coming, only Allah know what happened.. so be careful.. you can smoke stupid shisah also . no tatse. but very high price.  I give only 1 🌟coz  having my food I run . there some staff  have no permit I saw police there doing something . be careful all of you",0
great place to chill with your friends,1
"slowly slowly oregi 😆😆 will be closed . it's true . today I see 10:30 am oregi didn't open. oregi food is very bad taste in my life ,👎",0
"Just paid RM84 for a meal for two which includes a lamb Mandy (RM20 for lamb and RM8 for rice which is really stupid to be honest) a lamb Maqlubah (RM30), Tabouleh (RM12) and two drinks (RM7 each). Might as well have authentic “Arab cuisine” somewhere else for that price.",0
Food are really overprice. They need RM2 for just a cheese powder.,0
"If the food takes too long, should’ve inform the customer. Its not 15-20 minutes late, its way way way late. I shouldve come to another instant cafe.",0
Small portion of food and the price raise way too much,0
"Price hike is unjustified. Dude RM 20 for your pasta, please do share how you came up with this figure and share your food cost. 
180grams pasta + cream + chicken stock + bacon bits, estimation of cost price 5.50 including labour cost and utilities. Focus on turn overs not a food cost percentage hike.  A reasonable selling price would be Rm12 to Rm 15.",0
"Really sad to see the prices hiked up so dramatically. Was a regular here, and now won't go back again. The price increase is not justified. No upgrades or improvement to the place or food. Unjustified. It's sad because I used to love this place.",0
"Food are delicious, esp the stew lamb, would prefer to be with mint sauce if possible. The drinks are special too.",1
"The price is ridiculous, RM20+ for a pasta is too much when you operate like a regular mamak. No wonder there is less customer here compare to how it used to be. If you decide to up the price, please at least upgrade your interior/ambient/service!",0
Fantastic food. The lamb and the chilli sauce were unbelievably delicious.,1
Food was great! Chicken mandy rice is highly recommended!!,1
"The food is great and the price are very reasonable. Superb place to hang around. The staff is very friendly. Even though this is my time having meal here, they are very politely introduce which food are the famous. Definitely will go again next time.",1

Taste never disappoint me 👍 Good food and friendly staffs. Highly recommend here for friends gathering or family meet up 🤗,1
Quality food with great taste… never regret to give it a try…,1
This is highly recommended for anyone who enjoy good fusion cuisine. Price is reasonable. Must try their sous vide chicken and pesto pasta with prawn.,1
"*DO NOT COME HERE if you do not appreciate GOOD FOOD made with quality ingredients. A pleasant surprise.
Passed it a few times and decided to try. It was rather quiet. We ordered with trepidation as we tried a new (to us) place the night before and the food was really not good. But the environment and decor, although stark, exudes a warmth welcome. Partly due to the smile from the service staff. And you can feel a genuine smile behind a mask.
Ordered the recommended pork ribs, pork ragu pasta and added the mushroom soup. Drinks were wild berry soda and a special matcha soda not in the menu yet. The pork ribs was served with pickled cucumber and a potato croquette (not your typical croquette). The rib was tender and the sauce pleasant without overpowering. The cucumber complemented the meat well as its not the usual salad or mash serving. The croquette is pleasant but not up my alley. Portion was small for me but for a normal eater, should be fine. The pasta, on the other hand, was just as delicious. Having ragu in pasta is usually a challenge but this worked very well, not too wet, not too dry. The mushroom soup was decent enough but the toast stick was fantastic. I could munch on a few of that. The drinks were served in old-fashioned glasses and made them look like speakeasy cocktails. Both drinks were refreshing. The matcha soda’s first few sips didn’t yield much but subsequently tasted good once the flavors mixed up well. There were other ingredients but I forgot what they were.
Overall, quite amazing food with impressive plating and presentation. Serving fusion food made with quality ingredients in SS2 is a challenge but they are the only ones in the area and I must say, they prepare their food well and with care. It is not for everyone but if you are in the area, give them a try instead of the usual SS2 fare. You’ll be surprised. Will definitely return to try the rest.

The food is nice! made by a local chef ! The environment is good too! I highly recommend trying it out!,1
"The served really good meal and coffee, thumbs up! 👍🏻 will come back again 😁",1
"My childhood buddy and I had a pleasant time at Country Barn Pub & Restaurant. Decent crowd, mildly lighted and spacious restaurant with comfortable seats. Staffs were very attentive to customers. Customers didn't need to attract the staffs attention, the staffs keep walking around and enquired with body language if we need anything or a refill of beer. Food was good with ample portion and nice crisp beer to our thirst. The live singing troupe was good with melodious voices, a little showmanship would do good though.
I highly recommend this place, my friend and I were throughly impressed by the pub environment and impeccable services. The menu showcased a variety of innovative dishes, blending bold flavours. Do check out Country Barn at USJ, you won't regret the time spend there.

If you're not rushing hour this place can be considered. Food serving takes abit longer time than others restaurant. Food taste not to my expectations.,0
"We had a friends appreciation dinner at NOTA; about 12 of us. Instead of ordering ala carte, we went with Alex’s (the owner) suggestion of sharing platters, so that everyone can enjoy the same food together.  Well, we didn’t regret at all. The tuna salad with watermelons was amazing. The duck confit was a little dry on the legs, but not chewy. The duck breasts was lovely. Moist !!! We had lamb and grilled Striploins. I extremely enjoyed the grilled beef. There was this white fish. It was fresh with good texture. If the lemon bitter was a tad less, I would’ve enjoyed more.  We ended the dinner with aged cheddar cheese platter and some alcoholic cakes. So good !! Would definitely come back again. Great hospitality from the service staff too.",1
"Lovely food and ambient, small mock-tail drinks are a bit pricey. Went in during peak hour, staff not entirely equipped to manage big crowd. Some are friendly and some were not under pressure. Would definitely come by again and support Kota Kemuning Cafes.",1
Love the environment and delicious dessert💗 Most importantly the staff in the cafe are super friendly! ✨👍🏻,1
"I normally do not write on food review, unless it is mana from heaven, or food from hell where the devil himself wouldn’t  even eat, and consider dying 2nd time then eating  , I waited painstaking hungry for 30 minutes , later to be persecuted with some unrecognised burn chicken . How are wish Gordan Ramsey is here to do the roasting “ why did the chicken offended the chef?”",0
"Had a wonderful experience here! Our family dropped in for coffee today. One staff in particular - a lovely young lady by the name of Diana (hope I got the name right) - was extremely attentive, knowledgeable on the menu and details of the coffee, and entertained all our questions patiently. The latte was superb, and the salted caramel praline slice was 10/10. Not forgetting, the cosy interior was a whole vibe. Thanks Diana, your barista friend & whole crew ",1

"1st time visiting this Cafe located on the 1st floor, in Kota Kemuning. Awesome environment, very cozy and home feel. Perfect for a relaxing weekend meal. The food is tasty and very unique. I highly recommend this cafe.",1
Went during lunch hour when it wasn’t very crowded yet we had to wait for more than an hour for the food to be served. What made the whole experience worst was food served was either different from the menu (all croissants replaced with a slice of sourdough) or tasteless. The anchovies pasta was as though a plain pasta. Definitely not worth paying high price for such terrible experience. ,0
Good Foods .  Nice ambience .,1
"Overall ambience is beautiful and the service was fast. 
However the chicken served was abit undercooked as you can see from the photo. When we clarified with the waitress, she claimed that the chicken has been sous vide for hours and she is firm that the chicken is cooked. 
Well, we did give our suggestion to them before we left that maybe they should increase the water temperature.",0

Nice ambient and great food,1
"A really cozy cafe that gives you the chill and MUJI/homey ambience vibes with legitimately good food. My personal favourites are The Rotisserie (lots of protein) and Salmon Tataki & Avocado (toast with generous serving of fresh salmon and avocados) 😋 For drinks, their coolers/mocktails like Pink Peach Tea and Sparkling Mango Rose Tea is a must especially if you’re visiting in the afternoon. Apparently their food is locally produced with a twist of their own recipe! Staffs are helpful too, but there’s room for improvement for their engagement. Overall a really nice and pleasant place to do your work and dine in. It’s my second time here already and the experience never disappoints 👍",1

Beet seafood restaurant ever with good service as well. My family and I go there quite often. Be sure to ask the chef for their specials or any recommendations. He won’t disappoint. Also be sure to order their fruit juices when you’re dining ,1

"This Indian Pub nestled in a growing township, Bandar Rimbayu, serves up interesting Indian Fusion dishes. They mainly focus on South Indian dishes but they do have Western favourites like lamb chop, pasta and pizzas 😍🍝 Price is very affordable and portion is fairly generous too! They also serve a variety of cocktails and liquor for people who wanna get drunk (and wasted) 🤣 
Their cocktails & mocktails are rather fancy as mine came with a beautiful blue umbrella and the sour plump one came with a syringe 😍💉 Really unique way of serving cocktails and it’s instaworthy too 😉 My favourite was the Chicken Tandoori Pizza! 🍕 The chicken was well marinated and the pizza was so cheesy 🤤🧀 I love how the pizza crust was thin and crispy, so it doesn’t feel too heavy after a few slices 😋 Anchovies varuval is also a must order here as they are spicy, addictive, crunchy and packed with oomph 🔥 Perfect bar snack to pair with your beer 🍺 As for the mutton fried rice and Claypot mutton rice, both dishes were wholesome! Plenty of mutton chunks (although some were a bit fatty and chewy) 🐐 If you’re adventurous, do try their Wildboar Claypot Rice 🐗 I wanted to try it, but it wasn’t available that day - they’re particularly famous for it 😜 They even have rice dishes where you can choose your meat like sambal chicken, kamheong chicken, anchovies etc. I loved the sambal chicken as their sambal is the sweet kind ☺️ Everything was really delicious and overall I would say it was a decent meal 👍🏻 They have a snooker table too, so head over with your friends to drink and play some games 🎱  Also, do check out their Instagram page to find out more about their ongoing CNY promo & weekly promos! You might be lucky and get some free drinks 🥂🥳",1
Great place to chill and enjoyed their food and beverages,1
Exciting new concept bar . Friendly staff,1

I went with my 3 toddler there. Waited for the food for almost an hour. We asked staff over there. He told me the food will be there in 5mins. But we waited for another 15mins.. Yet we didn't receive any food. We decided to leave my children was to hungry. We told the staff this was a terrible service. Surprisingly the staff didn't say even a sorry and told us that other customer can wait. The table after us got the food. He spoked so rudely. Thereby this shop staff and the owner who Was seating there practically don't have any proper hospitality service.,0
Supper service and good food in klang valley and good prices for food and good  family restaurants in all klang valley ,1

"Shop environment and the food was really great!!! The owner was very down to earth to all customers. Surely will pay a visit with my family soon.
I would recommend this shop to all Indian food lovers!",1
"Ordered their lunch set I got the tandoori chicken set and my friend got the mutton briyani. Although the service was fast, the food was disappointing. Firstly, the chicken tandoori was just dry. I had a hard time chewing it, felt I was chewing a cardboard. The masala was coated well around the chicken but dry chicken didn’t make it any tasty. The mutton briyani on the other hand was very bland and did not have flavour. The fragrance of the briyani (something like rose water) was overpowering the briyani itself.",0
mainly all that is stated very much satisfied with services provided,1
The food not as good as mentioned,0
Good Food. Great food. The starter mix pakora platter is a great way to start a meal. Suitable for vegetarian and non vegetarian. Their paneer dishes are recommended. Their briyani is  just awesome  and they have set lunch which is reasonable and good. Gulab Jamun is a must try.,1
"Love it....What an excellent and lovely restaurant, good food and great service.... The butter chicken was  just YUMMY!!!“  All of our orders came exactly as we wanted.. all 10 of us loved this restaurant.. Will definately come again..",1

"If anyone is looking for the most authentic kulfi, please make your way to this gem of a restaurant. Honestly, best kulfi in the world!! Thank you for satisfying my sweet cravings!",1
Such a good place to have our dinings but what the waiter did really pissed me off..  He didn't listen to the order properly and end up blaming us for the extra order.. He was kinda rude where he walked away while I was still explaining him things.. That seriously pissed me off,0
Hyderabad Mutton Briyani and Mango Lassi was awesome...Mutton Tika wasn't spicey as mention in their menu..too sour & salty taste..Peaceful envoirement and friendly staff.,1
Had a delicious briyani over here.... Calm place n friendly workers. .,1
"friendly waiter recommend the food that taste just good and we love it, definitely going back again! But is Indian food normally that salty?",1
"When you are from a family of fantastic Indian cooks and painful critics, it is always not easy to please them or yourself. But Garam Masala North Indian Restaurant got double thumbs up today! Their mutton and fish dishes were awesome. The price is reasonable and the potions were plenty. Thank you and we enjoyed our Indian palate! Keep up the good work!!!",1

There are only 2 tables occupied and service takes more than half an hour! Staff doesn’t seem to be bothered at all! Absolutely pathetic and unacceptable! Food quality and standards have gone down too! I’m surprised this restaurant hasn’t gone out of business yet!,0
The service is super slow.  It took 40 minutes for two orders. When the food arrived it is already cold.,0
The food was good. And also the staff was friendly.,1

Had to wait 1 hour for grilled items!!! One of the worst service restaurant I've been to.,0
Worst place for service. They are not bother of people going there for Iftar. Serve food late and only half what was ordered. Dont even bothered to inform us earlier.,0
"Got to get your act together. Not exactly a new restaurant, so today's performance poor and testing our patience.
Table 15 booked at 7 pm for 10 people for iftar.
6 patrons arrived ant 7.05 pm or so. 5 mixed grill ordered and 1 Mandi Chicken. 5 mango juice and 1 iced tea also ordered.
7.27 pm broke fast with dates that was on the table
7.30 pm another patron joined the table and ordered Mandi Lamb and mango juice.
7.40 pm Mandi lamb arrived. (this patron arrived late, but got his food ahead of those who arrived early and those that fasted)
8.10 pm food arrived, but it was not what we ordered. We were served kebab instead of mixed grill. Server said we ordered kebabs. We insisted that they checked the orders. Confirmed it was mixed grill. Then they said ""upstairs"" changed the orders. We asked to speak to ""upstair"".
15 mins later ""upstairs"" said that the mixed grills were taken by servers and given to other tables. They ran out of mixed grills and decided to serve us kebabs instead. Then we should have been told. I have never had this kind of experience before. The servers were aware that later tables got food ahead of us. 
Why were we not told that our orders were changed by ""upstairs"". I won't comment about the food as we're not in the right frame of mind. When we settled our bills... there was no attempt to make up for the mistakes at all.",0

"Dear Concern,
I would like to write down my sincerely complaint regarding what happen at your Restaurant. 
This my first time having dinner with all my colleague total of us is 16 person at DIMA Restaurant whereby this restaurant recommended one of my friend. but service very disappointed and totally bad experience we get from your side.
On 28 March 2014  
Branches Petaling Jaya Oasis Square.
Attention to Mr Mohaizan Mohamudiah
                   Head Sales & Marketing  
Below is my chronology,
20:45 - Just for you info that we make reservation before we come to your restaurant. We seat and start order like normal.
21:00 - I'm just arrived at restaurant seat awhile see the menu and start order like normal. 
21:20 - We start celebrate my friend birthday with drink only. Food come later we start uncomfortable because we totally hungry. After that we cut the cake as our main course due food not ready yet. We ask the waiter and waitress they said sorry sir the order will come to you. with face so angry due to we ask them. 
21:45 - Few my friend get the order as per request. and leave the 1 drink and 2 main course is it ""Nasi Arab"", "" Kamsi"" and ""pineapples juice"" as known the famous food there. time to time almost 1 hour again we ask the waitress again. the answer is nothing???blurrrr....one more thing behind us just arrived coupe of customer but get order very quickly instead us need to wait and wait.  
22:20 - All my friend finish they eat and our food still not yet ready. im feel so fed up and I call the waiter said where is my order???The brilliant staff answer my question "" Nasi belum masak lagi"" Or "" sorry sir the rice finished we need to cook again""...Wow I feel so angry on that time. imagine that im need to wait almost 2 hour to get my Nasi Arab... totally not make sense (IMAGINE). How you feel if you in my situation.  
22:30 - After wait more the 2 hours 30 minits my order is coming and the pineapples juice together. how i feel that no mood to eat already because other friend need to going back earlier because follow the LRT transportation. I'm make decision to take away my order due time so limited and need to sent one of my friend. no word to say on this real situation my first experience make worse in my life.
22:40 - We start to settled the bill and double check the bill. the amount we spend is RM280.80 can you imagine the amount the we need to pay is it worth???
I feel it is important that you be aware of the behavior of your employees. I have not shared this experience with any of my friend or on any social media.
KINDLY GIVE US THE EXPLANATION REGARDING WHAT HAPPEN IN MY SITUATION.
Complaint letters are not fun to write, but can help improve the situation. GOOD LUCK

"Just love dining here, a very well tuck hidden within a housing area here in Ara Damansara. Yes i am referring to this authentic Korean taste called Mimi Korean Restaurant. We two had their pre grilled pork shoulder set that comes with the kimchi soup and cheese. Here i love their homemade side dish kimchi, it was brilliant, for sure one of the best kimchi in town. We had many helpings. We coated our ready to eat pork shoulder with cheese and had it wrapped with lettice and other side condiment and bean paste. We also had a Korean pancake, yums. It was good and we truly enjoy our meal.",1
"Best Korean food in town , like it very much",1

Decent Korean food but small portions.,1
"We went on d recommendation of a good friend (Thanks Angeline!). Ordered a serving of pork shoulder on hot plate, a bowl of kimchi soup with pork & hot barley teas.
While they prepared d mains, we were served side dishes with green coral lettuce to wrap yr desire. Fun experimenting with blending d different flavours. D additional bean sauce & pinch of salt to add depth to yr taste. Reloaded a few of our favourite side dishes.
Pork shoulder arrived & we were pleasantly surprised with d generous serving. Kimchi soup also had generous chunks of pork as well.
Overall a nicely balanced healthy meal. We polished off everything including d bed of onions & cabbage protecting d meat fr overcooking, as it absorbed all d meat’s juicy flavours.
Pricing is reasonable for d quality of d ingredients.",1
This is my favourite Korean restaurant in KL. I cant remember how many time i come here d. I always bring my friends and family here to enjoy authentic korean food. We love kimchi here a lot. Very high recommended in this restaurant.,1

No need to twist the flavors. Falafel sandwich comes with tahini sauce and lots of vegetable. Please STOP baking your own breads, they are terrible. Buy fresh Arabic bread from the Arabic grocery shop. For BBQ put the sauces in small separate containers. Don't mix everything together. I hope that help.",0
Friendly staff's and healthy food.,1
"i have ordered grillee chicken with bread, mandy chicke  with rice and baba ganoush via grabfood. Grab service ia tiptop. but the food is suxxx maaan. rice tastes like white rice, no taste at all. both chicken not cooked well, too dry and tasteless. baba ganoush is full of cut onion and almost no brinjal... i always eat baba ganoush. this is the worst i have ever eaten. 
overall, i do not recommend this place to anyone. do not get cheated by the reviews. better order from a place you know or go to a restaurant you know. otherwise, do not waste ur money.",0

"Sorry I just dropped to your restaurant just now n for the first impression experience of first 1 minute, everything fail as in service. 
- No welcoming or greeting.
- your staff through the menu to me upside down without any word so I felt I am entering a funeral not a restaurant. 
- where is the best first impression service. All your staff look want to die.
- their grooming and personal hygiene is out and not clean. Hiw do you serve food to eat and put it in my stomach. 
- the smell of the restaurant is bad. 
- the waiter (Sudan guy) are setting down and never come to me to ask whether I want to order or not. 
- what if I am a customer who want to do function or catering with you ? How do I feel .. ? U better close down ur business ... 
- my apologies but how come your investment of 600k can be presented like this to customer? 
- I just want to bring your attention to this so you will know what is happening at your cafe. 
- best regards to you",0

"Had dinner with some friends here today at Bombay Spice Bangsar. Ordered their crab masala, crab rasam and kashmiri rogan josh with some indian breads. Food tasted delicious. No complaints and worth the money spent. However, a suggestion to the management, the restaurant service can be improved if they had more staffs. Will definitely come back!",1
"Today was our first time at the newly opened Bombay Spice in Bangsar. Ordered 3 vegetarian Thali meals ogether with some Lamb and Chicken Tikka. Food was so bad! The basmathi rice was raw and not properly cooked. Waiter took it back into the kitchen, microwaved it and brought it back out. Thinking we would not know the difference. Never bothered to apologise about it. The Chef who were so free standing around, clearly had no pride in their cooking, did not even visit our tabl… See more",0
"A great dining experience.. delicious food, an extensive menu and super friendly staff.",1
I have to give a shout-out to the lady waitress with long hair & one of the chef. I'm sorry I didn't get their names.They offered us a new corn cob when ours fell on the floor. That is so thoughtful & my baby niece loved it! Overall other staffs were also amazing. Food was great if not better. Keep up the good work! ,1

"As a food delivery rider, the food has been delayed for more than 40 minutes from the scheduled pick up time and I'm still waiting for the food to be ready. Definitely the customer won't be happy too! Restaurant promised the food can be ready by 630pm.  But it's 725pm already and the food is not ready.",1
chicken chop portion is quite satisfied.,1
totally messed up my order which was for my folks for valentines. 7pm delivery and at 8pm was asked to cancel order. parents ended up having maggie mee for valentines.,1

"good food, good service..",1
Best steak in town...in fact all the food are delicious...friendly staff.....recommend to all my friends and family to try here...tqsm  to all moons staff,1
Excellent food...... I tried many steak house and this is the only place I can get a perfect medium rare steak. My family very satisfied with our order....... Will visit again and again,1
"Soups ordered were cold - as in the top part was warm (not even hot) and the bottom ice-cold. Sent back and later soups were returned piping hot (sure case of it being microwaved as the cup was hot). The kitchen didn't bother changing the cup coz it had soup splatter all over the side. 
Spaghetti was mushy and unappetizing. Cream sauce was luke-warm causing it to separate. Fish & Chips came with cheap Mayonnaise instead of Tartare sauce. And everything was salty - soup, fish etc.
The food quality does not live up to the price tag. A huge let down - especially after seeing all the reviews",0
Such a delicious western food. I bet u will keep repeating to have your food there.,1
"Overall the food is marvelous. I had my sizzling steak while my wife had a sizzling chicken. My childrens had chicken chop and 2 kid meals. However the customer services need to improve. Maybe just because im wearing round neck and a tracksuit, maybe. If u have taken care on that aspect surely vote for 5 stars",0
The lobster is delicious and nicely cooked. But it took almost 45 minutes for our food to be ready including the steak. We arrived quite early before 8pm and only 3 tables were occupied before us. The waiter should inform us earlier if the food take so long to be prepared.,1
Onion soup was awesome! And double awesome since i eat with garlic bread .. beef ribs was good and the lobster can just be eat like that without any gravy since it was so fresh and juicy... service given also was tip top... they also give me points! Love it!,1
"We had the garlic butter lobster and chutney glazed lamb. Both were fantastic. Onion soup was good and best eaten while it is still hot.Peach tea was delicious. I think most of their food are reasonably priced and serving size was good. Attentive staff, if you hate waiting, maybe it is best to come before peak hours as they can be pretty busy. Good location,near the Putra Heights train station and ample parking bays.",1
Nice ambience... Polite crew... Great food... what more to ask... love it!!!,1
The steak was perfect. Superb environment. Absolutely a must try for steak lovers out there,1
"Big portion. Creamy chicken spagetty very full loaded in my stomach. 
Garlic Butter Lobster also higly recommended. The ambience very cosy & cool. To colebrate e love one, anniversary or candle light dinner, should choose Moon's Kitchen.",1
"Let's start with appetizers: the mushroom soup with garlic bread was super delicious. The baked onion soup is truly amazing, and of course, the garlic herb mussels are just heavenly! For the main course, the mushroom sauce, especially on lamb is the best! Also tried the black pepper and brown sauce steaks, they were exceptionally tender at medium! And the caramel milkshake was sooo smooth, unlike anything I've had. Delicious! Would definitely come again, next time for the lobster! ;D",1
Love the lobster thermidor,1
Worth to Try once.  Lobster meat was fresh. Portion was small though.,1
"Can try Fish & Chips, not bad. But for grilled chicken chop, the meat was a bit hard, may need to improve on that. Overall will revisit it.",1
"My chidlren loved it (fish & chips, lamb chutney). My wife say it's okay (mushroom soup & old english steak). Good job. InsyaAllah will return.",1

"A review. 
Smlm aku dgn husband having a small celebration dekat restaurant @moonskitchenputraheights , jgn risau dkt sgt dgn rumah tak lebih radius 10km ya. 
Still mematuhi SOP ketat P.K.P 2.0 🥲🥲

Apa yg aku impressed all the food I ordered was good! And aku mmg several times mkn kt sini, last rasanya TIGA TAHUN LEPAS 🥲🥲
tp rasa sedap tu masih sama. Side dishes ponn sedap except for the corn. Tawar sikit laa.

Harga pon sgt la affordable and reasonable gituu. Aku rasa antra paling murah in town! Owned by Muslim so no doubt. InsyaAllah. So siapa yg nk merasa boleh pegi try. 
In fact, parking senang and kedai pon x crowded.

"Teruk betul restoren ni, especially bulan puasa. Sorry aku kasi review sini sbb kat panda x leh nak review kan.. aku dh order dr pukul 2tghr utk berbuka puasa. Delivery time aku set kul 630ptg. Come on la be reasonable, ni aku order utk berbuka puasa.. 630 aku expect makanan aku smpai tp 630 gak ko cancel order.. mmg takde hati perut. Ko fikir tak, mana aku nak cr makan time 630 tu? Bila semua tmpt pun penuh.. ?? Dengan kes covid tgh mencanak2 skrg ni? So aku TAK rekemen restoren ni.",0
